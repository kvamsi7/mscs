 In the Assignment 1 of ICP-1, I have deleloped the solution for three problems.
 
 Key points to notice for each program:
 program 1.1 and 1.2: 
   - Used list slicing method and delete the characters from the list
   - Used strings .joins() method to concatenate the list of charecters 
   - Used python way of string reverse method
   - Used '**' double asterisks to calculate the power of a number in pythonic way
 program 2:
   - Used strings .replace() method to replace a string with another string which is quite fast.

 program 3:
   - Added edge case to check score range of 0 to 100 and calculated the grade using if and elif
