 In the Assignment 5 of ICP-5, I have developed the solution for two problem statements

#### Key points to notice for each program:
  - In the first problem where i have used the naive bayes theorem on the dataset that was provided.
  - In the second problem where i have used the linear support vector machine algorithm on the same dataset
  - compared the performance of both models on the test dataset and reported the results and conclusion why and which performed well.
