The flavors were balanced perfectly, with each ingredient shining through without overpowering the others.What truly set this place apart was the attention to detail. The presentation of the food was artistic, the timing between courses was impeccable, and the staff went above and beyond to accommodate our requests, making us feel truly special.I cannot recommend this place enough. Whether you’re looking for a place to celebrate a special occasion or just in search of a delightful dining experience, this should be at the top of your list. We’re already looking forward to our next visit!\"]\n",
    "review_test_n = [\"Unfortunately, my recent visit to the restaurant left much to be desired. Despite the high expectations set by its reputation, the experience was underwhelming from start to finish. Upon arrival, the greeting was lukewarm, and it took a noticeable amount of time before we were seated, despite having reservations.The menu, while extensive, seemed to lack coherence, and the descriptions did little to entice the palate or clarify what one might expect from each dish. When our orders finally arrived, the presentation was lackluster, and the flavors were surprisingly bland. A particular disappointment was the main course, which was not only overcooked but also arrived lukewarm, suggesting it had been sitting out for some time.Service throughout the evening was inconsistent; our server seemed disinterested and was seldom seen. Attempts to address our concerns about the meal were met with indifference, leaving us feeling unvalued as customers.Given the price point and the establishment's reputation, I expected a dining experience that delighted the senses and showcased culinary excellence. Unfortunately, what I encountered was a forgettable meal paired with service that failed to meet even basic standards of hospitality. It's unlikely I'll return or recommend this restaurant to others based on this visit.\"]\n",
    "review_test_neu = [\"My recent visit to the restaurant was a mixed experience. Walking in, the ambiance of the place was inviting, with a nicely decorated interior that promised a cozy dining atmosphere. The staff greeted us politely and seated us without delay, which was a good start to the evening.The menu presented a wide array of options, ranging from traditional favorites to some intriguing chef specials. It took some time to make our selections, partly due to the variety and partly because the menu descriptions could have been more detailed.When the food arrived, the presentation was decent, and the portions were generous. Some of the dishes we tried were quite satisfying, offering a good balance of flavors and freshness. However, a few items fell short of expectations, lacking the depth of flavor we anticipated. It was a hit or miss on the culinary front.Service was generally efficient, though it lacked the warmth and attentiveness that elevate a dining experience from good to great. Our server was courteous but seemed rushed, making our interactions feel somewhat transactional.The overall value for the money was fair, considering the portion sizes and the quality of the ingredients used. However, the inconsistency in the food and service left us feeling that while the restaurant has potential, there's room for improvement in execution and attention to detail.In conclusion, while the visit didn't fully meet our expectations, it wasn't a disappointing experience either. For those considering dining here, there might be dishes that delight, but I'd recommend managing your expectations when it comes to service and some menu items.\"]"
